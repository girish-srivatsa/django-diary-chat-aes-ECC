Used a key encryption key(kek) generated by hashing user password 1000 times with sha256 and encrypt generated database encryption key(dek) by AES-256
then all post data of user is encrypted by dek of user

For chat a public private key pair is generated by curve secp256r1 i.e,y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> -3x + b where b = 41058363725152142129326129780047268409114441015993725554835256314039467401291 and with characteristic field g = 2<sup>256</sup> - 2<sup>224</sup> + 2<sup>192</sup> + 2<sup>96</sup> -1

and symmetric key for each chat is generated by ECC(multiplying public_key of other with private_key of current) and is used to encrypt chat messages by AES-256
